# 🌐 Day 1 of HTML

📌 What is a Website?

* A Website is a collection of web pages.
  Example: Home, About, Contact pages.

---

📌 Elements in a Webpage

Some common elements we can create in a webpage are:

* Button
* Image
* Video
* Text
* Scrollable text
* Icons
* Background image
* Paragraph
* Heading

We use HTML tags to create these elements.

---

### 📌 Important Points

* HTML is case-insensitive → <H1> and <h1> mean the same.
* Headings in HTML:

  * <h1> (largest/most important) → <h6> (smallest/least important).

---

### 📌 Commonly Used Tags

* <b> → Bold text
* <i> → Italic text
* <em> → Emphasized text (similar to italic, but more meaningful)
* <strong> → Strong importance (similar to bold, but more meaningful)
* <small> → Smaller text
* <br> → Line break
