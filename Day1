------------------------------------------------Day 1 of HTML(September 19, 2025)------------------------------------------------------


HTML - HyperText Markup Language.


HTML is the foundational building block of the web. 

It provides the skeleton or structural layer of a webpage, defining its content and basic layout.

While you can write HTML code in a simple text file (and save it with a .html extension), the best practice is to use a dedicated code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Editors like VS Code provide essential features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection, which make writing code faster and less error-prone.






Assignments :-

# 🌐 Day 1 of HTML

📌 What is a Website?

* A Website is a collection of web pages.
  Example: Home, About, Contact pages.

---

📌 Elements in a Webpage

Some common elements we can create in a webpage are:

* Button
* Image
* Video
* Text
* Scrollable text
* Icons
* Background image
* Paragraph
* Heading

We use HTML tags to create these elements.

---

### 📌 Important Points

* HTML is case-insensitive → <H1> and <h1> mean the same.
* Headings in HTML:

  * <h1> (largest/most important) → <h6> (smallest/least important).

---

### 📌 Commonly Used Tags

* <b> → Bold text
* <i> → Italic text
* <em> → Emphasized text (similar to italic, but more meaningful)
* <strong> → Strong importance (similar to bold, but more meaningful)
* <small> → Smaller text
* <br> → Line break
